# Project
Alien Odyssey is a survival game where you play as an alien that has crash landed on earth. You need to find a way to survive amongst humans and repair your ship so that you can make it back to your planet. The game was developed as part of the Project in the course DH2650 Game Design at KTH. To try out the game you can visit our releases page on [Github](https://github.com/DH2650-Game-Design-Group-15/Project/releases) or our [website](https://alien-odyssey.web.app/). You can also clone the repo and build the project with Unity.
